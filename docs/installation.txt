Installation instructions
=========================

This document describes the steps needed to get Towel up and running.

Towel is based on Django_, so you need a working Django_ installation
first. Towel is developed using Django_ 1.3, and is not guaranteed to
work with any earlier version.

Despite being used in production for over a year, ther eis no stable
release of Towel yet. You should therefore download the code using
Git_::

    $ git clone git://github.com/matthiask/towel.git

Towel has no dependencies apart from Django_.

You should add Towel to ``INSTALLED_APPS``. This isn't strictly required
though -- you may use the tools contained without adding Towel to
``INSTALLED_APPS``, but you will not be able to use the
bundled templates and the template tags.
